📝 Full ESPN Commentary:
Murray is dealing with a foot injury that kept him to a DNP/DNP/LP practice progression 
this week. According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Murray is dealing with a mid-foot 
sprain that is "a version of a Lisfranc injury" and that could sideline the nimble 
quarterback for more than one week. While the Cardinals haven't completely closed the 
door on Murray playing Sunday, it appears the team will most likely turn to Jacoby 
Brissett to start at quarterback against Indianapolis. Brissett is familiar with the 
Colts organization, having played for the club for four seasons from 2017 through 2020.

## 🎯 DFS Impact

### **Why This Matters for Lineup Building**

1. **Backup QB Identification**: Know who's stepping in (Brissett, Huntley, etc.)
2. **RB Committee Changes**: When starter is out, backups get flagged
3. **Target Share Shifts**: Know which WRs benefit from WR1 injuries
4. **Game Script Changes**: Backup QBs = more run-heavy = RB boost

### **Affected Players Use Cases**

- Kyler out → **Jacoby Brissett** starts
- CMC injured → **Jordan Mason** gets carries
- Tyreek out → **Jaylen Waddle** gets targets
- Andrews out → **Isaiah Likely** gets TE targets

## 🧪 Testing

**Test Files Created:**
- `test_espn_kyler.py` - Kyler Murray specific test
- `test_espn_raw.py` - Raw API response viewer
- `test_espn_integration.py` - Full integration test

**All tests passed ✅**

---

## 🔮 Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. **Auto-flag affected players in player selection**
   - If Kyler is out, highlight Jacoby Brissett
   - If CMC is out, boost Jordan Mason's smart value

2. **Injury severity scoring**
   - "Questionable" = 70% chance to play
   - "Doubtful" = 25% chance to play
   - Adjust projections accordingly

3. **Practice report tracking**
   - DNP/Limited/Full progression
   - Friday practice = best indicator

4. **Multi-week injury trends**
   - Track how long players have been on report
   - Flag chronic injuries (hamstring, back)
