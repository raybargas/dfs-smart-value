## üîß What Was Fixed

### Problem 1: Wrong Endpoint
**Before:** Used `injuries.json` ‚Üí returned 0 injuries  
**After:** Using `injury_history.json` ‚Üí returns 594 injuries ‚úÖ

### Problem 2: Invalid Parameters
**Before:** Sent `season` and `date` parameters ‚Üí caused timeout  
**After:** Only sending `force=true` ‚Üí works instantly ‚úÖ

### Problem 3: Incorrect Parser
**Before:** Looked for injuries in wrong data structure  
**After:** Correctly extracts from `playerReferences[].currentInjury` ‚úÖ

### Problem 4: Database Constraint
**Before:** API name "MySportsFeeds" violated database check  
**After:** Changed to lowercase "mysportsfeeds" ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. DETAILED Addon Required
Your subscription **must** include the DETAILED addon. Without it, you'll receive a **403 Forbidden** error.

### 2. Current Injuries Only
The endpoint returns **current** injury status. It does not provide historical injury data by specific week/date.

### 3. No Date Parameter
**Do NOT** add a `date` parameter - it causes the API to timeout. Omitting it returns current injuries automatically.

### 4. Rate Limiting
- The Streamlit UI has a 15-minute cooldown between API calls
- Use cached data when possible to preserve your API quota
- The free tier has limited daily requests

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Test the app UI:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   Then go to Narrative Intelligence tab and click "Refresh Injury Reports"

2. ‚úÖ **Integrate with player pool selection:**
   - Use injury status to filter out "Out" players
   - Flag "Questionable" players for manual review
   - Prioritize healthy players in optimizer

3. ‚úÖ **Set up data refresh schedule:**
   - Refresh injury data 1-2 hours before lineup lock
   - Monitor status changes on game day
   - Check practice reports during the week

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If you get 0 injuries:
Run: `python3 test_updated_client.py`

If test succeeds but app fails, clear the Streamlit cache.

### If you get 403 Forbidden:
Your subscription doesn't include the DETAILED addon.  
Visit: https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/account/

### If you get timeout:
Check that you're NOT adding a `date` parameter to the API call.

### If database errors:
The api_name must be lowercase "mysportsfeeds" in the APICallLog table.
