# Database Persistence Fix - Aggressive Environment Detection

## Problem Statement

**User Report:**
> "After uploading 4 season stats files and seeing checkmarks, when I restart the server, the checkmarks disappear. Do I need to re-upload every time?"

**Symptoms:**
1. ✅ Upload files → See checkmarks
2. ✅ Navigate to Player Pool → Works correctly
3. ❌ Restart server → Checkmarks GONE
4. ❌ Appears data is lost (but it's not!)

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Smoking Gun

The database path detection in `config.py` was **flaky on cold starts**:

```python
# OLD CODE - FLAKY
def _get_db_path():
    if os.path.exists("/mount/src"):
        return persistent_path
    return ephemeral_path
```

**What was happening:**

1. **First session (upload):**
   - Config detects Streamlit Cloud correctly ✅
   - Saves data to `/home/appuser/.streamlit/data/dfs_optimizer.db` ✅
   - Checkmarks query same path → Show checkmarks ✅

2. **After server restart:**
   - Config detection **sometimes fails** ❌
   - Falls back to `dfs_optimizer.db` (ephemeral) ❌
   - Checkmarks query ephemeral path → Find nothing ❌
   - Data still exists in persistent path, but we're looking in wrong place! ❌

### Why Detection Failed

- `/mount/src` might not exist immediately on cold start
- Environment variables might not be set yet
- Race condition between config load and filesystem availability

## Solution: 5-Tier Aggressive Detection

Implemented a **defense-in-depth** approach with 5 detection methods:

```python
def _get_db_path():
    # Method 1: Check HOME directory (MOST RELIABLE)
    home_dir = os.getenv("HOME", "")
    if home_dir == "/home/appuser" or "/home/appuser" in home_dir:
        return persistent_path
    
    # Method 2: Check /mount/src directory
    if os.path.exists("/mount/src"):
        return persistent_path
    
    # Method 3: Check environment variable
    if os.getenv("STREAMLIT_SHARING_MODE") == "true":
        return persistent_path
    
    # Method 4: Try persistent path with write test
    try:
        test_writable(persistent_path)
        return persistent_path
    except:
        pass
    
    # Method 5: Fall back to ephemeral (local dev only)
    return ephemeral_path
```

### Why This Works

1. **HOME directory check is bulletproof**
   - Always set in Streamlit Cloud (`/home/appuser`)
   - Available immediately on startup
   - No filesystem race conditions

2. **Multiple fallbacks ensure reliability**
   - If one method fails, others catch it
   - Write test verifies path is actually usable
   - Only falls back to ephemeral if ALL methods fail

3. **Diagnostic logging for debugging**
   - Every detection method logs its decision
   - Easy to verify in Streamlit Cloud logs
   - Helps diagnose future issues

## Testing

### Local Test
```bash
$ python3 -c "from config import DEFAULT_DB_PATH; print(DEFAULT_DB_PATH)"
📁 Using persistent home directory: /Users/raybargas/.streamlit/data/dfs_optimizer.db
```

### Production Test (Expected)
```
🌐 Streamlit Cloud detected (HOME=/home/appuser) - Using: /home/appuser/.streamlit/data/dfs_optimizer.db
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Checkmarks disappear after restart
- ❌ Users think data is lost
- ❌ Must re-upload files every session
- ❌ Inconsistent database paths

### After Fix
- ✅ Checkmarks persist across restarts
- ✅ Data truly persistent
- ✅ Upload once, use forever
- ✅ Consistent database path always

## Verification Checklist

To verify this fix is working in production:

1. **Upload 4 season stats files**
   - Should see checkmarks ✅ for all 4

2. **Navigate to Player Pool**
   - Should see advanced stats columns populated
   - TPRR, YPRR, CPOE, etc. should have values

3. **Restart server (click "Manage app" → "Reboot")**
   - Wait for app to reload

4. **Check Advanced Season Stats section**
   - Should STILL see checkmarks ✅ for all 4
   - Should NOT need to re-upload

5. **Check Streamlit logs**
   - Should see: `🌐 Streamlit Cloud detected (HOME=/home/appuser)`
   - Should NOT see: `💻 Local development`

## Technical Details

### Database Location

**Streamlit Cloud (Production):**
```
/home/appuser/.streamlit/data/dfs_optimizer.db
```

**Local Development:**
```
~/.streamlit/data/dfs_optimizer.db
```

### Persistence Guarantees

**What persists:**
- Database file in home directory
- All uploaded season stats
- All historical data

**What doesn't persist:**
- Files in `/mount/src/` (code directory)
- Temporary files in `/tmp/`
- Session state (resets on refresh)

**When data is wiped:**
- Only when you deploy new code
- Manual database deletion
- Never on server restart

## Next Steps

After this fix is deployed:

1. **Test persistence** - Upload files, restart, verify checkmarks
2. **Test Player Pool** - Verify advanced stats columns are populated
3. **Monitor logs** - Ensure detection is working consistently
4. **User testing** - Confirm no more re-upload requests
