## 💡 How to Use This Data

### 1. Enrich Your Player Pool CSV

Match players from your DFS CSV with last week's performance:

```sql
-- Get recent stats for players in your pool
SELECT 
    p.player_name,
    p.team,
    p.position,
    -- Receiving work
    SUM(p.targets) as targets,
    SUM(p.receptions) as receptions,
    SUM(p.receiving_yards) as rec_yds,
    -- Rushing work
    SUM(p.rush_attempts) as carries,
    SUM(p.rush_yards) as rush_yds,
    -- Total production
    SUM(p.rush_yards + p.receiving_yards) as total_yds,
    SUM(p.rush_touchdowns + p.receiving_touchdowns) as total_tds,
    -- Game script (team score)
    g.home_score,
    g.away_score
FROM player_game_stats p
JOIN game_boxscores g ON p.game_id = g.game_id
WHERE p.player_name IN ('Your', 'CSV', 'Players')
GROUP BY p.player_name, p.team;
```

### 2. Identify Volume Leaders

**High-Target WRs/TEs:**
```sql
SELECT player_name, team, position,
       SUM(targets) as targets,
       SUM(receptions) as catches,
       ROUND(SUM(receptions) * 100.0 / SUM(targets), 1) as catch_rate
FROM player_game_stats
WHERE position IN ('WR', 'TE') AND targets > 8
GROUP BY player_name, team
ORDER BY targets DESC;
```

**Bell-Cow RBs (20+ touches):**
```sql
SELECT player_name, team,
       SUM(rush_attempts + targets) as touches,
       SUM(rush_attempts) as carries,
       SUM(targets) as targets
FROM player_game_stats
WHERE position = 'RB'
GROUP BY player_name, team
HAVING touches >= 20
ORDER BY touches DESC;
```

### 3. Game Script Analysis

**Players in High-Scoring Games (team total 30+):**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.player_name, p.team, p.position,
       CASE 
           WHEN g.home_team = p.team THEN g.home_score
           ELSE g.away_score
       END as team_score
FROM player_game_stats p
JOIN game_boxscores g ON p.game_id = g.game_id
WHERE (g.home_score >= 30 AND g.home_team = p.team)
   OR (g.away_score >= 30 AND g.away_team = p.team)
ORDER BY team_score DESC;
```

**Players in Blowouts (losing teams passing more):**
```sql
-- WRs from teams that lost by 14+ (garbage time targets)
SELECT p.player_name, p.team, SUM(p.targets) as targets,
       CASE 
           WHEN g.home_team = p.team THEN g.home_score - g.away_score
           ELSE g.away_score - g.home_score
       END as margin
FROM player_game_stats p
JOIN game_boxscores g ON p.game_id = g.game_id
WHERE p.position = 'WR' AND p.targets > 0
HAVING margin <= -14
ORDER BY targets DESC;
```

### 4. Find Emerging Players

**Players with 10+ targets (breakout candidates):**
```sql
SELECT player_name, team, position,
       targets, receptions, receiving_yards, receiving_touchdowns
FROM player_game_stats
WHERE targets >= 10 AND position IN ('WR', 'TE')
ORDER BY targets DESC;
```

**RBs with 5+ targets (pass-catching backs):**
```sql
SELECT player_name, team,
       rush_attempts, targets,
       rush_yards + receiving_yards as total_yards
FROM player_game_stats
WHERE position = 'RB' AND targets >= 5
ORDER BY targets DESC;
```

## 📊 Example: Match to Your CSV

If your DFS CSV has these players, here's what you now know:

| Player | Salary | Last Week Targets | Last Week Yards | Hot/Cold |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Ja'Marr Chase | $8,500 | **12** | **193** | 🔥 HOT |
| Garrett Wilson | $7,200 | **23** | **101** | 🔥 VOLUME |
| D'Andre Swift | $7,800 | 2 (23 touches) | 120 | ✅ GOOD |
| James Cook | $7,600 | 3 (23 touches) | 99 | ✅ GOOD |

**Insight:** Ja'Marr Chase had 193 yards on 12 targets - he's in elite form. Garrett Wilson saw **23 targets** - that's insane volume even if efficiency was lower.

## 🎯 80/20 Win: What This Gives You

### ✅ **You can now answer:**
- Who got the most targets last week?
- Which RBs are handling 20+ touches?
- Who's in high-scoring offenses?
- Which teams were in blowouts (game script)?
- Who's emerging (increased usage)?

### ✅ **For Your DFS Strategy:**
- **Volume = Targets + Touches** - prioritize high-volume players
- **Game Script** - favor players in close/high-scoring games
- **Trend Detection** - compare to Week 4, 3, 2 (when you add them)
- **Value Plays** - find low-salary players with high volume

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):
1. ✅ Week 5 data stored
2. ✅ Run queries to identify hot players
3. ✅ Match with your DFS player pool CSV
4. ✅ Build lineups prioritizing high-volume players

### Future (80/20 Expansion):
- **Add Week 6** after games complete (same process)
- **Add Weeks 3-4** for 3-week trends
- **Calculate week-over-week changes**
- **Build "hot hand" scoring multipliers**

## 🔧 Quick Reference Commands

### Check Your Data:
```bash
cd /Users/raybargas/Desktop/Gauntlet_Flow/DFS
sqlite3 dfs_optimizer.db "SELECT * FROM game_boxscores;"
sqlite3 dfs_optimizer.db "SELECT * FROM player_game_stats LIMIT 10;"
```

### Export to CSV:
```bash
sqlite3 dfs_optimizer.db << 'EOF'
.headers on
.mode csv
.output week5_targets.csv
SELECT player_name, team, position, SUM(targets) as total_targets
FROM player_game_stats WHERE targets > 0
GROUP BY player_name, team
ORDER BY total_targets DESC;
.quit
EOF
```

### Python Integration:
```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

conn = sqlite3.connect('dfs_optimizer.db')

# Get high-volume WRs
wr_targets = pd.read_sql_query("""
    SELECT player_name, team, SUM(targets) as targets
    FROM player_game_stats
    WHERE position = 'WR' AND targets > 8
    GROUP BY player_name, team
    ORDER BY targets DESC
""", conn)

print(wr_targets)
```
