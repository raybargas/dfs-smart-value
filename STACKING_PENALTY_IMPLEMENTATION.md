# Stacking Penalty Implementation

## Overview

The stacking penalty system addresses unrealistic lineup construction where optimizers create lineups with 3+ players from the same team. This implementation applies penalties post-generation to Smart Value scores, making lineups more realistic for tournament play.

## Problem Statement

Traditional DFS optimizers can generate lineups with excessive same-team stacking (e.g., QB + RB + WR + TE from the same team). While this maximizes projected points, it creates unrealistic scenarios where all players would need to hit their ceilings simultaneously, which rarely happens due to:

- Game script dependencies
- Diminishing returns on offensive production
- Defensive adjustments
- Injury/rotation factors

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Stacking Detection (`stacking_analyzer.py`)

**Core Functions:**
- `detect_stacking_patterns(lineup)`: Analyzes lineup for same-team player counts
- `calculate_stacking_penalty(lineup, penalty_weight)`: Calculates penalty multiplier
- `get_stacking_analysis(lineup)`: Provides detailed analysis with human-readable output
- `apply_stacking_penalty_to_lineups(lineups, penalty_weight)`: Applies penalties to lineup list

**Penalty Rules:**
- 2 players per team: No penalty (legitimate stacking)
- 3 players per team: 10% Smart Value reduction
- 4+ players per team: 20% Smart Value reduction
- Multiple teams with 3+ players: Penalties are additive
- Maximum penalty capped at 50%

### 2. Integration Points

**Optimizer (`optimizer.py`):**
- Added `stacking_penalty_weight` parameter to `generate_lineups()`
- Applies penalty post-generation using `apply_stacking_penalty_to_lineups()`
- Penalty is applied after all lineups are generated but before returning results

**UI Components:**
- **Optimization Config (`optimization_config.py`)**: Added stacking penalty weight slider (0-100%)
- **Lineup Generation (`lineup_generation.py`)**: Passes penalty weight to optimizer
- **Results Display**: Shows stacking analysis in lineup details

### 3. User Interface

**Stacking Penalty Weight Slider:**
- Location: Optimization Configuration page
- Range: 0-100% (default: 50%)
- Visibility: Only shown when "Primary Stack" is enabled
- Tooltip: Explains penalty rules and logic

**Tooltip Content:**
```
Penalty for excessive same-team stacking (3+ players). Higher values reduce unrealistic lineups with multiple players from the same team.

Penalty Rules:
‚Ä¢ 2 players per team: No penalty (legitimate stacking)
‚Ä¢ 3 players per team: 10% Smart Value reduction
‚Ä¢ 4+ players per team: 20% Smart Value reduction
‚Ä¢ Multiple teams with 3+ players: Penalties are additive
‚Ä¢ Maximum penalty capped at 50%
```

## Implementation Details

### Penalty Calculation Logic

```python
def calculate_stacking_penalty(lineup: Lineup, penalty_weight: float = 1.0) -> float:
    team_counts = detect_stacking_patterns(lineup)
    total_penalty = 0.0
    
    for team, count in team_counts.items():
        if count >= 3:
            excess_players = count - 2  # 2 players is acceptable
            
            if count == 3:
                team_penalty = excess_players * 0.10  # 10% penalty
            elif count == 4:
                team_penalty = excess_players * 0.20  # 20% penalty
            else:
                team_penalty = min(excess_players * 0.30, 0.30)  # 30% cap
            
            total_penalty += team_penalty
    
    # Apply penalty weight multiplier
    final_penalty = total_penalty * penalty_weight
    
    # Cap total penalty at 50%
    return min(final_penalty, 0.50)
```

### Smart Value Adjustment

```python
def apply_stacking_penalty_to_lineups(lineups: List[Lineup], penalty_weight: float = 1.0) -> List[Lineup]:
    for lineup in lineups:
        penalty = calculate_stacking_penalty(lineup, penalty_weight)
        
        # Apply penalty to Smart Value (if it exists)
        if hasattr(lineup, 'smart_value') and lineup.smart_value is not None:
            lineup.smart_value *= (1.0 - penalty)
        
        # Store penalty info for debugging/display
        lineup.stacking_penalty = penalty
        lineup.stacking_analysis = get_stacking_analysis(lineup)
    
    return lineups
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Stacking detection with various team distributions
- Penalty calculation for different scenarios
- Integration with lineup generation flow

### Test Scenarios
1. **Normal Lineup**: 2 players max per team ‚Üí 0% penalty
2. **QB/WR Stack**: 2 players from same team ‚Üí 0% penalty
3. **3-Player Stack**: 3 players from same team ‚Üí 10% penalty
4. **4-Player Stack**: 4 players from same team ‚Üí 20% penalty
5. **Multiple Teams**: 3+ players from multiple teams ‚Üí additive penalties

### Validation Results
```
=== Testing Realistic Stacking Scenarios ===
Normal lineup: 0.0% penalty - ‚úÖ No stacking detected (all teams have ‚â§2 players)
QB/WR stack: 0.0% penalty - ‚úÖ No stacking detected (all teams have ‚â§2 players)
3-player stack: 10.0% penalty - ‚ö†Ô∏è KC: 3 players | üìâ Penalty: 10.0% Smart Value reduction
```

## Benefits

1. **Realistic Lineups**: Reduces unrealistic same-team stacking
2. **Tournament Viability**: Creates more tournament-viable lineups
3. **User Control**: Adjustable penalty weight via UI slider
4. **Post-Generation**: Doesn't interfere with optimization process
5. **Transparent**: Clear penalty rules and analysis

## Configuration

### Default Settings
- **Stacking Enabled**: True (for GPP tournaments)
- **Penalty Weight**: 50% (moderate penalty)
- **Maximum Penalty**: 50% (prevents extreme cases)

### Customization
- Users can adjust penalty weight from 0-100%
- Penalty is disabled when stacking is disabled

## Future Enhancements

2. **Game Script Awareness**: Consider game totals and spreads in penalty calculation
3. **Historical Validation**: Use historical data to validate penalty effectiveness
4. **Advanced Stacking Rules**: Support for bring-back stacks and game stacks

## Files Modified

2. **`src/optimizer.py`**: Integration of stacking penalty into lineup generation
3. **`ui/optimization_config.py`**: Added stacking penalty weight slider
4. **`ui/lineup_generation.py`**: Passes penalty weight to optimizer

## Dependencies

- No new external dependencies
