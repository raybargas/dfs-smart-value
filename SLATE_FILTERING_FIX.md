# Slate Filtering Fix - 2025-10-16

## 🐛 **The Problem**

**User reported**: "Why 4k+ players? That's too many in a week. Something is wrong."

**Root Cause**: MySportsFeeds DFS API returns **ALL SLATES** for a given week, not just the main slate:

```
Week 7 Response = 33 Slates:
- Featured (150 players)
- Classic (150 players)
- Showdown - Game 1 (6 players)
- Showdown - Game 2 (6 players)
- ... (29 more slates)
= 4,948 total player entries
```

Many players appear in **multiple slates**, so the same player (e.g., Patrick Mahomes) was listed 10+ times.

---

## ✅ **The Solution**

Filter to **only the main slate** (Featured or Classic) immediately after fetching:

### **Code Added** (`ui/data_ingestion.py`)

```python
# Filter to main slate only (Featured or Classic)
# MySportsFeeds returns ALL slates (33+), but we only want the main one
original_count = len(df_salaries)
if 'slate_label' in df_salaries.columns:
    # Prioritize Featured slate, fallback to Classic
    if 'Featured' in df_salaries['slate_label'].values:
        df_salaries = df_salaries[df_salaries['slate_label'] == 'Featured'].copy()
    elif 'Classic' in df_salaries['slate_label'].values:
        df_salaries = df_salaries[df_salaries['slate_label'] == 'Classic'].copy()
    else:
        # Use the first slate if neither Featured nor Classic exists
        first_slate = df_salaries['slate_label'].iloc[0]
        df_salaries = df_salaries[df_salaries['slate_label'] == first_slate].copy()
    
    st.info(f"🎯 Filtered to main slate: {original_count} → {len(df_salaries)} players")

# Remove duplicate players (keep first occurrence)
if 'player_name' in df_salaries.columns:
    df_salaries = df_salaries.drop_duplicates(subset=['player_name'], keep='first')
    st.info(f"📊 Removed duplicates: {len(df_salaries)} unique players")
```

---

## 📊 **Expected Result**

### Before Fix:
```
✅ Loaded 4948 players
```

### After Fix:
```
🎯 Filtered to main slate: 4948 → 490 players
📊 Removed duplicates: 150 unique players
✅ Loaded 150 players
```

## 🎯 **Why This Makes Sense**

A typical DFS main slate has:
- **~10-14 games** (most NFL Sunday games)
- **~10-15 players per team** (QB, RBs, WRs, TEs, DST, K)
- **= ~150-200 total players**

This is the standard size for DraftKings/FanDuel main slates.

## 🔍 **Slate Types Explained**

MySportsFeeds returns multiple slate types:

| Slate Type | Games | Players | Use Case |
|------------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Featured** | 10-14 | ~150 | Main Sunday slate (most common) |
| **Classic** | 10-14 | ~150 | Alternative main slate |
| **Showdown** | 1 | ~6 | Single game (captain mode) |
| **Turbo** | 3-4 | ~40 | Early/late-only games |
| **Tiers** | 10-14 | ~150 | Tiered salary structure |

We default to **Featured** because it's the most popular DFS contest format.

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. ✅ Fix deployed to GitHub
2. ⏳ Wait 30-60s for Streamlit Cloud to redeploy
3. ⏳ Test "Fetch Auto" again - should show ~150 players
4. ⏳ Verify Player Selection loads quickly (no 5-min wait)

---

## 📝 **Future Enhancement**

Add a **slate selector** in the UI:
```python
st.selectbox("Select Slate", options=['Featured', 'Classic', 'Showdown', 'All'])
```

This would let users choose which slate to optimize for.
