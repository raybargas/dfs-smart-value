Stacking Analyzer Module

This module analyzes DFS lineups for same-team stacking patterns and calculates
appropriate penalties based on realistic correlation scenarios.

The stacking penalty addresses the issue where optimizers create unrealistic
lineups with 3+ players from the same team, which rarely all hit their ceilings
simultaneously due to game script dependencies and diminishing returns.
