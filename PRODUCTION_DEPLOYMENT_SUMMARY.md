# 🚀 Production Deployment Summary

**Deployment Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED & TESTED  
**Branch:** main

---

## 📦 What Was Deployed

### 1. SQL Reserved Word Fix
**Files:**
- `src/advanced_stats_db.py` - Column `drop` → `drops`
- `migrations/008_separate_advanced_stats_tables.sql` - Column `drop` → `drops`

**Impact:** Fixes "near drop: syntax error" on app startup

### 2. Database Architecture Migration
**Old System:**
- Single `advanced_stats` table
- INSERT OR REPLACE destroyed data across file types
- Checkmarks disappeared after uploading different file types

**New System:**
- Four separate tables: `pass_stats`, `rush_stats`, `receiving_stats`, `snap_stats`
- Each table manages its own data independently
- No data overwriting between file types

### 3. UI Verification Fix
**File:** `ui/data_ingestion.py`

**Change:** Updated verification query to check all 4 new tables instead of old single table

**Impact:** Success messages now show accurate record counts

### 4. Database-First Loading
**Files:**
- `src/season_stats_analyzer.py` - Prioritizes database over files
- `ui/player_selection.py` - Removed hardcoded legacy file path

**Impact:** 
- Uses uploaded database data automatically
- No more file path errors
- Works on any device with uploaded data

## ✅ Local Testing Results

### Test 1: SQL Syntax
- ✅ Tables create without errors
- ✅ No "near drop: syntax error" messages
- ✅ Both inline creation and migration file work

### Test 2: Data Persistence
- ✅ Saved Pass stats: 60 records
- ✅ Saved Rush stats: 248 records
- ✅ **Pass stats still present after Rush save** (critical fix!)
- ✅ Both tables maintain independent data

### Test 3: Complete Upload Flow
| File Type | Input Rows | DB Records | Status |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Pass      | 247       | 60         | ✅     |
| Rush      | 879       | 248        | ✅     |
| Receiving | 2,143     | 424        | ✅     |
| Snaps     | 2,613     | 528        | ✅     |

**Total:** 1,260 unique player records across 4 tables

### Test 4: UI Checkmarks
- ✅ Pass: Shows checkmark (60 > 10 threshold)
- ✅ Rush: Shows checkmark (248 > 10 threshold)
- ✅ Receiving: Shows checkmark (424 > 10 threshold)
- ✅ Snaps: Shows checkmark (528 > 10 threshold)

### Test 5: Database Structure
- ✅ All 4 tables created with correct schemas
- ✅ UNIQUE constraints working
- ✅ Indexes created
- ✅ Triggers for timestamps working

## 🐛 Known Issues (Fixed)

### Issue 1: SQL Reserved Word ✅ FIXED
**Before:** `drop INTEGER` caused syntax error  
**After:** `drops INTEGER` works correctly

### Issue 2: Data Overwriting ✅ FIXED
**Before:** Uploading Rush deleted Pass data  
**After:** Each file type saves to its own table

### Issue 3: Wrong Table Query ✅ FIXED
**Before:** Verification queried old `advanced_stats` table  
**After:** Verification queries all 4 new tables

### Issue 4: Hardcoded File Path ✅ FIXED
**Before:** Looked for "2025 Stats thru week 5.xlsx"  
**After:** Loads from database first, graceful fallback

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Streamlit Cloud logs ("Manage app" → View logs)
2. Verify database tables exist (should auto-create on first upload)
3. Try uploading files again (idempotent - safe to retry)
4. Contact developer with error message
