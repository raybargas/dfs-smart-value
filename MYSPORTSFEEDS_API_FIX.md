# MySportsFeeds API Issue Diagnosis & Fix

## Date: October 10, 2025
## Status: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED AND TESTED**

---

## üéâ Final Solution Summary

**Working Endpoint:** `injury_history.json` (without date parameter)
**Result:** Successfully fetches **594 current NFL injury reports**

---

## üîç Issues Identified

### 1. **Wrong Endpoint** (Critical)
The code was using the `injuries.json` endpoint which returned 0 injuries.

### 2. **Invalid API Parameters** (Critical)
The code was sending `season` and `week` parameters to the MySportsFeeds injuries endpoint:
```python
params = {
    'season': '2025 Regular',
    'week': '6'
}
```

**Problem:** According to the MySportsFeeds v2.1 API documentation, the injuries endpoint **does not accept these parameters**.

**Valid parameters for `/injuries.json`:**
- `player` - Filter by player(s)
- `team` - Filter by team(s)
- `position` - Filter by position(s)
- `sort` - Sort the results
- `offset` - Pagination offset
- `limit` - Maximum number of results
- `force` - Force fresh content (avoid 304 responses)

### 2. **Endpoint Behavior Misunderstanding**
The injuries endpoint returns **CURRENT injuries only**, not historical data for specific weeks or seasons.

### 3. **Missing Subscription Requirement**
The API documentation states:
> **Addon Required**: DETAILED

Your MySportsFeeds subscription **must include the DETAILED addon** to access injury data. Without it, you'll receive a **403 Forbidden** error.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated API Request**
**File:** `src/api/mysportsfeeds_api.py`

**Before:**
```python
endpoint = 'injuries.json'
params = {
    'season': f"{season} Regular",
    'week': str(week)
}
```

**After:**
```python
endpoint = 'injuries.json'
params = {}

# Add optional filters
if team:
    params['team'] = team
if position:
    params['position'] = position

# Force fresh content (avoid 304 responses)
params['force'] = 'true'
```

### 2. **Updated Method Signature**
Added optional filtering parameters:
```python
def fetch_injuries(
    self,
    season: int = 2025,        # For database storage only
    week: int = 6,             # For database storage only
    use_cache: bool = True,
    cache_ttl_hours: int = 6,
    team: Optional[str] = None,     # NEW: Optional team filter
    position: Optional[str] = None  # NEW: Optional position filter
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
```

**Note:** `season` and `week` parameters are kept for backward compatibility and database storage, but they are **not sent to the API**.

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
Added specific error messages for subscription issues:

```python
if response.status_code == 401:
    raise APIError(
        f"Authentication failed (401): Check your API key in .env file"
    )
elif response.status_code == 403:
    raise APIError(
        f"Access forbidden (403): Your subscription may not include the DETAILED addon required for injury data. "
        f"Visit https://www.mysportsfeeds.com to upgrade your plan."
    )
```

### 4. **Updated Documentation**
- Enhanced class docstring with requirements
- Updated `API_SETUP.md` with DETAILED addon requirement
- Added notes about current-only injury data

## üß™ Testing Your API

Run the diagnostic test script:

```bash
cd /Users/raybargas/Desktop/Gauntlet_Flow/DFS
python test_mysportsfeeds_api.py
```

This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Verify your API key is configured
2. ‚úÖ Test the injuries endpoint
3. ‚úÖ Show detailed error messages
4. ‚úÖ Display sample injury data if successful

### Expected Outcomes:

**‚úÖ Success (200):**
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS! API connection working.
Total injuries found: 42
Sample injury data (first 3 players):
1. Christian McCaffrey (SF)
   Status: QUESTIONABLE
   Injury: Hamstring
...
```

**‚ùå Missing DETAILED Addon (403):**
```
‚ùå ACCESS FORBIDDEN (403)
‚ö†Ô∏è  YOUR SUBSCRIPTION DOES NOT INCLUDE THE REQUIRED 'DETAILED' ADDON
```

**‚ùå Invalid API Key (401):**
```
‚ùå AUTHENTICATION FAILED (401)
Possible causes:
- Invalid API key
- API key not activated
```

## üìã Action Items

### If you have the DETAILED addon:
1. Run the test script: `python test_mysportsfeeds_api.py`
2. If successful, the Streamlit app should now work correctly
3. Click "üîÑ Refresh Injury Reports" in the Narrative Intelligence tab

### If you DON'T have the DETAILED addon:
1. Visit https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/account/
2. Check your subscription plan
3. Add the DETAILED addon (pricing varies)
4. Or upgrade to a plan that includes it

### Alternative: Use Cached Data
If you don't want to upgrade:
- The app still works with uploaded CSV files (Phase 1 features)
- You can load previously cached injury data (if any exists)
- Consider using a different data source for injuries

## üìù Summary

The main issues were:
1. Using the wrong endpoint (`injuries.json` instead of `injury_history.json`)
2. Including a `date` parameter which caused API timeouts
3. Incorrect parser logic for the response format

The code has been fixed to:
1. ‚úÖ Use the `injury_history.json` endpoint
2. ‚úÖ Omit the `date` parameter (returns current injuries automatically)
3. ‚úÖ Parse injuries from `playerReferences` array correctly
4. ‚úÖ Map injury statuses properly
5. ‚úÖ Extract position, team, and injury details

## üéØ Final Working Solution

### Endpoint Used:
```
GET https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nfl/injury_history.json?force=true
```

### Key Changes:
- **Endpoint:** Changed from `injuries.json` to `injury_history.json`
- **Parameters:** Removed `date` parameter (causes timeout when included)
- **Parser:** Iterate through `references.playerReferences[]` and check `currentInjury`
- **Response Format:** Extract injury data from player reference objects

### Test Results:
```
‚úÖ 594 injury reports successfully fetched
‚úÖ Status breakdown:
   - 363 Questionable
   - 206 Out
   - 16 Probable
   - 9 Doubtful
```

Run `python3 test_updated_client.py` to verify it works with your API key!
